                                webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

                    <ol>
                        <li>The browser goes to the <span class = "colorfy">DNS Server</span> and finds the real address of the <span class = "colorfy">server</span> that the website lives on.</li>
                        <li>
                            The browser sends an <span class = "colorfy">HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to
                            the client.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span class = "colorfy">"200 OK" message</span>, which 
                            means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser 
                            as a series of small chunks.
                        </li>
                        <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>
